  gdstyle running in the Godot editor: linting, format-on-save, and right-click single-fix on the bottom panel.
</video>

A fast, opinionated linter and formatter for GDScript (Godot 4.x), built in Rust.

gdstyle catches style violations, naming inconsistencies, and common code-quality issues, and auto-formats GDScript to the [official Godot style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html). Many of the conventions are taken from Nathan Lovato and [GDQuest's GDScript style guide](https://gdquest.gitbook.io/gdquests-guidelines).

## Features

- 54 lint rules across syntax, naming, formatting, ordering, and code quality.
- Formatter (`gdstyle fmt`) that's in-place and idempotent, and reorders class members into the canonical Godot order.
- Auto-fix: `--fix` for the safe ones, `--unsafe-fix` for renames. Renames follow into other `.gd` files and into the `.tscn`/`.tres` scene wiring.
- Single static binary. No Python, no Rust toolchain, no Godot install required to run it.
- Optional Godot editor plugin: bottom panel with clickable diagnostics, single-click fixes, Lint/Format on save. Uses the GDExtension when present, falls back to the CLI binary otherwise.
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework integration out of the box (`gdstyle` and `gdstyle-fmt` hooks).
- Text and JSON output with configurable exit codes, so it slots into CI.
- TOML config (`gdstyle.toml`) with per-rule overrides and CLI flags for one-off tweaks.
- Per-line (`# gdstyle:ignore`) and per-file (`# gdstyle:ignore-file`) suppression comments, both with optional rule-list narrowing.
- Usable as a Rust library, not just a CLI.

## Installation

Pre-built binaries are available for all major platforms. You don't need a Rust toolchain unless you want to build from source.

### Pre-built binaries (recommended)

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/atelico/gdstyle/releases/latest)
2. Download the archive for your platform:
   - **Linux**: `gdstyle-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
   - **macOS (Intel)**: `gdstyle-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `gdstyle-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
   - **Windows**: `gdstyle-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`
3. Extract the `gdstyle` binary and place it somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bash
# Example for Linux / macOS
tar xzf gdstyle-*.tar.gz
cp gdstyle ~/.local/bin/   # or /usr/local/bin/, or anywhere on your PATH
```

### Building from source

To build from source you need a [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atelico/gdstyle.git
cd gdstyle
cargo build --release

# The binary is at target/release/gdstyle
cp target/release/gdstyle ~/.local/bin/
```

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install gdstyle
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Lint the current directory (recursively finds all .gd files)
gdstyle

# Lint specific files or directories
gdstyle check src/player.gd src/enemies/

# Auto-fix safe violations
gdstyle check --fix

# Auto-fix all violations including unsafe ones
gdstyle check --unsafe-fix

# Format all GDScript files in place
gdstyle fmt

## Auto-fix

gdstyle can automatically fix many violations:

```bash
# Fix safe violations only (formatting, naming conventions)
gdstyle check --fix

# Fix all violations including unsafe ones (signal renaming, member reordering)
gdstyle check --unsafe-fix
```

> **Fixes are written to disk in place.** There's no backup and no
> confirmation prompt. Commit or stash before running `--fix` or
> `--unsafe-fix`, then review the diff. (`gdstyle fmt --diff` previews
> formatter changes without writing.)

Safe fixes preserve behavior. Unsafe fixes can change semantics (renaming signals, variables, and other identifiers), so review the diff before committing.

When `--unsafe-fix` renames an identifier, gdstyle follows the rename across every `.gd` file in the project and into the `.tscn`/`.tres` scene files that wire signals or methods to that name. Anything it can't safely rewrite is reported as a warning so you can fix it by hand.

## Formatter

The `fmt` subcommand reformats GDScript files in a single pass:

```bash
# Format all .gd files in place
gdstyle fmt

# Check if files are already formatted (exit 1 if not)
gdstyle fmt --check

# Show a diff of what would change
gdstyle fmt --diff
```

The formatter normalizes indentation, trailing whitespace, blank lines (including the spacing between class members), boolean operators (`&&`/`||`/`!` to `and`/`or`/`not`), string quotes, comment spacing, colon and comma spacing, float and hex literals, trailing newlines, and single-line enums (expanded to multi-line). It reorders class members to match the canonical style guide order, and wraps long lines at commas inside parentheses, brackets, and braces. Running it twice produces the same output.

> **Note:** Line wrapping breaks at comma boundaries inside delimiters (parentheses, brackets, braces), `and`/`or` operators in `if`/`elif`/`while` conditions, and word boundaries in long comments. Lines without any breakable pattern (e.g., long strings, property chains, continuation lines without enclosing delimiters) are left alone.

## Configuration

gdstyle looks for a config file named `gdstyle.toml` or `.gdstyle.toml` in the current directory and walks up the directory tree until it finds one. You can also specify a config file explicitly with `--config`, or generate a starter one:

```bash
gdstyle init
```

### Example config file

```toml
# gdstyle.toml

# Maximum line length (default: 100)
max_line_length = 100

# Use tabs for indentation (default: true)
use_tabs = true

# Maximum function body length in lines (default: 50)
max_function_length = 50

# Maximum file length in lines (default: 1000)
max_file_length = 1000

# Maximum number of function parameters (default: 5)
max_parameters = 5

# Maximum return statements per function (default: 6)
max_returns = 6

# Maximum nesting depth inside a function (default: 4)
max_nesting_depth = 4

# Maximum local variables per function (default: 10)
max_local_variables = 10

# Maximum branches (if/elif/match) per function (default: 8)
max_branches = 8

# Maximum class-level variables (default: 15)
max_class_variables = 15

# Maximum public methods per class (default: 20)
max_public_methods = 20

# Maximum inner classes per file (default: 5)
max_inner_classes = 5

# File/directory patterns to exclude
exclude = [".godot", "addons"]

# Per-rule severity overrides
# Values: "off", "warn", "error"
[rules]
"format/double-quotes" = "off"             # Disable a rule entirely
"naming/class-name-pascal-case" = "error"   # Escalate to error
"quality/max-function-length" = "warn"      # Keep as warning
"quality/no-debug-print" = "warn"          # Enable an off-by-default rule
```

### Default configuration

When no config file is found, gdstyle uses these defaults:

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| `max_line_length` | 100 |
| `use_tabs` | `true` |
| `max_function_length` | 50 |
| `max_file_length` | 1000 |
| `max_parameters` | 5 |
| `max_returns` | 6 |
| `max_nesting_depth` | 4 |
| `max_local_variables` | 10 |
| `max_branches` | 8 |
| `max_class_variables` | 15 |
| `max_public_methods` | 20 |
| `max_inner_classes` | 5 |
| `exclude` | `[".godot", "addons"]` |

Most rules are enabled by default with `warn` severity. Three advisory rules (`quality/type-hint`, `quality/empty-function`, `quality/no-debug-print`) are off by default and must be explicitly enabled.

## Suppressing diagnostics

gdstyle has two ways to silence a warning from source: **per-line** for
spot exemptions and **per-file** for class- or file-scope rules. Both
use a `# gdstyle:ignore` comment, with the same `=rule1,rule2` syntax
for narrowing to specific rules.

| Directive | Scope | Form |
|---|---|---|
| `# gdstyle:ignore` | the **next** code line | standalone (own line) |
| `# gdstyle:ignore` | the **same** code line | inline (end of a code line) |
| `# gdstyle:ignore-file` | every diagnostic in the file | anywhere in the file |

Add `=rule1,rule2` to any of the above to narrow the suppression to a
comma-separated list of rule IDs. Without the `=...` suffix, every rule
is suppressed within that scope. Rule IDs are the full
`category/rule-name` shown in the diagnostic output (e.g.
`naming/variable-name-snake-case`).

### Per-line suppression

Standalone — applies to the next code line:

```gdscript
# gdstyle:ignore=naming/variable-name-snake-case
var BadName: int = 5
```

Inline — applies to the same line:

```gdscript
var BadName: int = 5  # gdstyle:ignore=naming/variable-name-snake-case
```

Bare (suppresses every rule on the target line):

```gdscript
# gdstyle:ignore
var BadName: int = 5
```

Multiple rules in one directive:

```gdscript
# gdstyle:ignore=naming/variable-name-snake-case,format/max-line-length
var SomeReallyLongVariableNameThatExceedsTheMaxLineLengthAndAlsoUsesTheBadNamingConvention: int = 5
```

### Per-file suppression

Use `# gdstyle:ignore-file` when the diagnostic isn't attached to a
single line, or when you genuinely want a whole-file exemption.
Anchor it at the top of the file by convention so future readers see
it immediately, but the parser accepts it anywhere.

```gdscript
# gdstyle:ignore-file=quality/max-public-methods
class_name OrchestrationFacade
extends Node
# ... 25 public methods follow
```

Multiple rules on one directive, or several directives stacked, both
work:

```gdscript
# gdstyle:ignore-file=quality/max-public-methods,quality/max-class-variables
# gdstyle:ignore-file=quality/max-inner-classes
class_name BigConfigDocument
```

A bare `# gdstyle:ignore-file` (no `=...`) disables *every* rule in
the file. Useful for generated code or third-party drops you don't
own:

```gdscript
# gdstyle:ignore-file
# This file is generated by build/gen.py — do not edit.
```

#### When to use which

- **Per-line** is the right tool for one-off exemptions where the
  diagnostic clearly belongs to a single line (a deliberately weird
  variable name, a long string literal, a public field you want to
  keep snake_case-violating because it mirrors a JSON key).
- **Per-file** is the right tool for rules that report against the
  whole class or file rather than a specific statement:
  - `quality/max-public-methods` (reports at the class header)
  - `quality/max-class-variables` (same)
  - `quality/max-inner-classes` (same)
  - `quality/max-file-length` (reports at line 1)
  - Generated files where any rule is moot.

  Trying to suppress these per-line is awkward at best (you have to
  put the comment inline on the `class_name` line, which makes the
  signature noisy) and impossible at worst (generated files have no
  natural spot for 50 inline comments).

#### Project-wide silencing

If you want to disable a rule across the entire project rather than
file-by-file, set it to `"off"` in `gdstyle.toml` instead:

```toml
[rules]
"quality/max-public-methods" = "off"
```

The TOML config and inline suppressions are independent; either one
silencing a rule is enough to drop the diagnostic.

## CI/CD integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: GDScript Style

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install gdstyle
        run: cargo install gdstyle

      - name: Check formatting
        run: gdstyle fmt --check

      - name: Lint GDScript files
        run: gdstyle check
```

### Pre-commit hook

gdstyle ships hooks for the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework.
Add the following to your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/atelico/gdstyle
    rev: v0.1.4   # pin to a released tag; bump with `pre-commit autoupdate`
    hooks:
      - id: gdstyle          # lint (fails the commit on diagnostics)
      - id: gdstyle-fmt      # format in place
```

Then install the git hook with `pre-commit install`. The first run builds
gdstyle from source via cargo, so the user needs a Rust toolchain on their
machine; subsequent runs are cached.

If you'd rather not depend on the pre-commit framework, a minimal raw git
hook also works:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

GD_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM -- '*.gd')

if [ -n "$GD_FILES" ]; then
    gdstyle check $GD_FILES
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "GDScript lint failed. Fix with 'gdstyle check --fix' or suppress with '# gdstyle:ignore'."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### JSON output format

When using `--format json`, gdstyle outputs a JSON array of diagnostics:

```json
[
  {
    "rule": "naming/variable-name-snake-case",
    "message": "Variable 'BadName' should use snake_case: 'bad_name'",
    "severity": "warn",
    "span": {
      "line": 5,
      "column": 1
    },
    "file": "src/player.gd"
  }
]
```

## Using as a library

You can also use gdstyle as a Rust library. Full API docs live at
[**docs.rs/gdstyle**](https://docs.rs/gdstyle).

```rust
use gdstyle::config::Config;
use gdstyle::linter;
use gdstyle::formatter;

fn main() {
    let config = Config::default();

    // Lint a file
    let diagnostics = linter::lint_file(
        std::path::Path::new("player.gd"),
        &config,
    ).unwrap();

    for d in &diagnostics {
        println!("line {}: [{}] {}", d.span.line, d.rule, d.message);
    }

    // Format a source string
    let source = "var x = 'hello'\n";
    let formatted = formatter::format_source(source, &config);
    assert!(formatted.contains("\"hello\""));
}
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains sample GDScript files you can use to try out linting and formatting:

```bash
# Lint the examples. Expect warnings about naming, formatting, and quality.
gdstyle check examples/

# See what the formatter would change
gdstyle fmt --diff examples/

# Auto-fix all safe violations
gdstyle check --fix examples/

# Format everything
gdstyle fmt examples/
```

## Testing

gdstyle has 383 tests: 161 unit tests, 219 integration tests, and 3 doctests.

```bash
cargo test           # Run all tests
cargo test --lib     # Unit tests only
cargo test --test integration_test  # Integration tests only
cargo clippy         # Lint check
```

## Godot editor plugin

A Godot 4.x editor plugin lives in `godot-plugin/`. It adds a bottom panel that runs gdstyle and shows clickable diagnostics inside the editor.

The plugin supports two backends:

- **GDExtension (native).** If the GDExtension library is present, it calls into Rust directly with no process overhead. Requires Godot 4.6+.
- **CLI fallback.** Spawns the `gdstyle` binary. If it isn't on `PATH`, a **Download** button fetches the right release from GitHub.

You can switch between backends at any time from the mode dropdown in the toolbar.

### Plugin features

- **Lint Project / Lint File.** Run the linter on every script in the project, or just the one you have open.
- **Fix File.** Apply all available auto-fixes to the current script in one click.
- **Format Project / Format File.** Same split for the formatter.
- **Lint on Save.** Lint after every save (on by default).
- **Format on Save.** Format before linting on save.
- **Right-click Fix.** Right-click any diagnostic with an auto-fix to apply it in place.
- **Click to navigate.** Double-click a diagnostic to jump to the source line.
- **In-memory editing.** Lint, fix, and format work directly on the editor buffer, no disk I/O.

### Installation (pre-built plugin)

1. Download `gdstyle-godot-plugin.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/atelico/gdstyle/releases)
2. Extract the `addons/gdstyle/` folder into your Godot project
3. Enable the plugin in **Project > Project Settings > Plugins**

### GDExtension API

When using the GDExtension backend, you can use `GdStyle` directly in GDScript:

```gdscript
var style = GdStyle.new()

# Lint a file.
var diagnostics = style.lint_res_file("res://player.gd")
for d in diagnostics:
    print("Line %d: [%s] %s" % [d["line"], d["rule"], d["message"]])
    if d["has_fix"]:
        print("  (auto-fixable, safe=%s)" % d["is_safe_fix"])

# Format a source string.
var formatted = style.format_source(source_code)

# Auto-fix violations.
var fixed = style.fix_source(source_code, "player.gd")

# Fix a single diagnostic by line and rule.
style.fix_at_line("res://player.gd", 12, "naming/variable-name-snake-case")

# Configure.
style.set_max_line_length(120)
style.disable_rule("format/double-quotes")
style.load_config_res("res://gdstyle.toml")
```
